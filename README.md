# Things to remember 

You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly
present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant
state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test
it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every
once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say: „How did he
do it? He must be a genius!”

– Richard Feynman

[The Philosophy of Computer Science](http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/computer-science/):

* Why are there so many programming languages and programming
  paradigms? (Krishnamurthi 2003)
* Do programming languages (and paradigms) have the nature of
  scientific theories? What causes a programming paradigm shift?
  (Kuhn 1970)

[Ten Lessons I wish I had been Taught](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html):

8\. Give lavish acknowledgments.

9\. Write informative introductions.
A lengthy introduction, summarizing the history of the subject, giving
everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly outlining the content of the
paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way towards getting
us a couple of readers.
